      <p>Websites of other listed businesses; and</p>
      <p>
        System-wide Accredited Businesses except soliciting non-profit
        organizations, charity shopping malls, and charity fundraising groups
        which may not hyperlink to our Web site.
      </p>
      <p>
        These organizations may link to our home page, to publications, or to
        other Website information so long as the link: (a) is not in any way
        deceptive; (b) does not falsely imply sponsorship, endorsement, or
        approval of the linking party and its products and/or services; and (c)
        fits within the context of the linking party's site.
      </p>
      <p>

      </ul>

      <p>
        We will approve link requests from these organizations if we decide
        that: (a) the link would not make us look unfavorably to ourselves or to
        our accredited businesses; (b) the organization does not have any
        negative records with us; (c) the benefit to us from the visibility of
        the hyperlink compensates the absence of MetLab; and (d) the link is in
        the context of general resource information.
      </p>

      <p>
        These organizations may link to our home page so long as the link: (a)
        is not in any way deceptive; (b) does not falsely imply sponsorship,
        endorsement, or approval of the linking party and its products or
        services; and (c) fits within the context of the linking party's site.
        If you are one of the organizations listed in paragraph 2 above and are
        interested in linking to our website, you must inform us by sending an
        e-mail to MetLab. Please include your name, your organization name,

        <li>By use of the uniform resource locator being linked to; or</li>
        <li>
          Using any other description of our Website being linked to that makes
          sense within the context and format of content on the linking party's
          site.
        </li>
        <li>
          No use of MetLab's logo or other artwork will be allowed for linking
